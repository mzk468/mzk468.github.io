# Zakariya's Portfolio

(Currently in Markdown, working on a Vue.js website coming soon!)

## About Me

I love programming. Whether it's for projects, assignments, or anything - it's a blast. There's always something new to learn, a challenge that absolutely stumps you to overcome, and even a social aspect to it at events like Hackathons that I live for!

## My Projects
I am currently working on building my portfolio over the summer. Feel free to check out my [Devpost](https://devpost.com/mzk468) to see my past Hackathon projects (they're not too great, but hey it's better than nothing!), whilst I work on adding more stuff onto here in the next couple months!
